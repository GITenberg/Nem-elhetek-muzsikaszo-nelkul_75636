summary: '"Nem élhetek muzsikaszó nélkül" by Zsigmond Móricz is a novel likely written
  in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Balázs, a young host celebrating
  his name day, who is initially surrounded by lively guests and music, but soon finds
  himself grappling with his personal relationships and the consequences of his hedonistic
  lifestyle. The setting captures the atmosphere of a rural Hungarian celebration
  while hinting at deeper societal themes.  At the start of the narrative, the festivities
  surrounding Balázs’ celebration are vividly depicted with guests and music filling
  the air. He is filled with joviality as he engages with his friends, but beneath
  the surface lies tension, particularly in his interactions with his wife, Pólika,
  who is increasingly dissatisfied with his indulgent behavior. As the night wears
  on, guests begin to leave, leading to a confrontation between Balázs and Pólika,
  which reflects their troubled marriage and Balázs’s inability to balance his desires
  with marital responsibilities. This opening sets the stage for exploring themes
  of joy, sorrow, and the struggle between personal fulfillment and familial duty.
